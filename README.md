# Marvel Mash Up

Marvel Mash Up is a site that allows users to search for up to six characters from the Marvel Comics universe and get a list of issues where only those characters appear together.

Users can also restrict results by date, either selecting historical comic book eras (Gold, Silver, Bronze, Modern) or input their own date range.

Each result features a link to that issue's page on Marvel's website as well as a link to purchase on Amazon.
